This is the page where there will be a directory of Authors, information about them and the posts they have contributed to.

Below could be an example of what this might look like:

<Placeholder for Author block>

This JS for the author data, on this page, as well as the posts, needs to be written by us, unless we can find some plugins/framworks to do that for us.
